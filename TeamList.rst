Winter 2015 Student Class Lists
###############################

This project just holds class/project lists.

It is intended to be a practice vehicle for students learning how to do
things the "proper" way.

See the `RST Specification 
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#simple-tables>`_ 
for help with restructured text tables.

*********
Team List
*********

These should be ordered by team name within set.


===  ==================  ===========  ========  ========  ========
Set  Team Name           Maintainer   Member 2  Member 3  Member 4
===  ==================  ===========  ========  ========  ========
4O   OnePercentSolution  Sanders Lee

*******
Process
*******

If you want to add or change your name in either of the above lists, 
fork the repository, clone it
locally, and then create a new branch (from master) for your change.

Once your branch is complete, and pushed to your forked repo, 
*then* create a pull request to merge it into this repository. 

Remember to "sign" your commits.

Pull requests to the repository will only be considered if they are signed,
from a class member, and don't break the list(s) they modify.
Team changes must come from the team repo maintainer.
